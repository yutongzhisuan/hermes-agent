"""Runtime smoke test for Docker $XHERMES_HOME/logs/gateways seeding.

Build the real image and verify logs/ and logs/gateways/ exist and are
owned by the xhermes user after container boot.

Regression guard for #45258: if the first gateway log service runs in
root context, logs/gateways/ is created root-owned; every profile
registered later runs its log service as the dropped xhermes user and
s6-log crash-loops on mkdir: Permission denied.
