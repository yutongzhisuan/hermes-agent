## Frequently Asked Questions

### What LLM providers work with XHermes?

XHermes Agent works with any OpenAI-compatible API. Supported providers include:

- **[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)** — access hundreds of models through one API key (recommended for flexibility)
- **[Nous Portal](/integrations/nous-portal)** — Nous Research's subscription gateway — 300+ models plus web/image/TTS/browser through one OAuth login (recommended for newcomers)
- **OpenAI** — GPT-5.4, GPT-5-codex, GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, etc.
- **Anthropic** — Claude models (direct API, OAuth via `xhermes auth add anthropic`, OpenRouter, or any compatible proxy)
- **Google** — Gemini models (direct API via `gemini` provider, OpenRouter, or compatible proxy)
- **z.ai / ZhipuAI** — GLM models
- **Kimi / Moonshot AI** — Kimi models
- **MiniMax** — global and China endpoints
- **Local models** — via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/), [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang), or any OpenAI-compatible server

Set your provider with `xhermes model` or by editing `~/.xhermes/.env`. See the [Environment Variables](./environment-variables.md) reference for all provider keys.

### Does it work on Windows/Android/Termux/my plataform??
See **[Platform Support](../getting-started/platform-support.md)** for the full platform availability matrix.

### I run XHermes in WSL2. What's the best way to control my normal Windows Chrome?

Prefer an MCP bridge over `/browser connect`.

Recommended pattern:

- run XHermes inside WSL2
- keep using your normal signed-in Chrome on Windows
- add `chrome-devtools-mcp` as an MCP server through `cmd.exe` or `powershell.exe`
- let XHermes use the resulting MCP browser tools

This is more reliable than trying to force XHermes core browser transport to attach directly across the WSL2/Windows boundary.

See:

- [Use MCP with XHermes](../guides/use-mcp-with-xhermes.md#wsl2-bridge-xhermes-in-wsl-to-windows-chrome)
- [Browser Automation](../user-guide/features/browser.md#wsl2--windows-chrome-prefer-mcp-over-browser-connect)

### Is my data sent anywhere?

API calls go **only to the LLM provider you configure** (e.g., OpenRouter, your local Ollama instance). XHermes Agent does not collect telemetry, usage data, or analytics. Your conversations, memory, and skills are stored locally in `~/.xhermes/`.

### Can I use it offline / with local models?

Yes. Run `xhermes model`, select **Custom endpoint**, and enter your server's URL:

```bash
xhermes model
# Select: Custom endpoint (enter URL manually)
# API base URL: http://localhost:11434/v1
# API key: ollama
# Model name: qwen3.5:27b
# Context length: 64000   ← XHermes minimum; set this to match your server's actual context window
```

Or configure it directly in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
model:
  default: qwen3.5:27b
  provider: custom
  base_url: http://localhost:11434/v1
```

XHermes persists the endpoint, provider, and base URL in `config.yaml` so it survives restarts. If your local server has exactly one model loaded, `/model custom` auto-detects it. You can also set `provider: custom` in config.yaml — it's a first-class provider, not an alias for anything else.

This works with Ollama, vLLM, llama.cpp server, SGLang, LocalAI, and others. See the [Configuration guide](../user-guide/configuration.md) for details.

:::tip Ollama users
If you set a custom `num_ctx` in Ollama (e.g., `ollama run --num_ctx 64000`), make sure to set the matching context length in XHermes — Ollama's `/api/show` reports the model's *maximum* context, not the effective `num_ctx` you configured.
:::

:::tip Timeouts with local models
XHermes auto-detects local endpoints and relaxes streaming timeouts (read timeout raised from 120s to 1800s, stale stream detection disabled). If you still hit timeouts on very large contexts, set `HERMES_STREAM_READ_TIMEOUT=1800` in your `.env`. See the [Local LLM guide](../guides/local-llm-on-mac.md#timeouts) for details.
:::

### How much does it cost?

XHermes Agent itself is **free and open-source** (MIT license). You pay only for the LLM API usage from your chosen provider. Local models are completely free to run.

### Can multiple people use one instance?

Yes. The [messaging gateway](../user-guide/messaging/index.md) lets multiple users interact with the same XHermes Agent instance via Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, or Home Assistant. Access is controlled through allowlists (specific user IDs) and DM pairing (first user to message claims access).

### What's the difference between memory and skills?

- **Memory** stores **facts** — things the agent knows about you, your projects, and preferences. Memories are retrieved automatically based on relevance.
- **Skills** store **procedures** — step-by-step instructions for how to do things. Skills are recalled when the agent encounters a similar task.

Both persist across sessions. See [Memory](../user-guide/features/memory.md) and [Skills](../user-guide/features/skills.md) for details.

### Can I use it in my own Python project?

Yes. Import the `AIAgent` class and use XHermes programmatically:

```python
from run_agent import AIAgent

agent = AIAgent(model="anthropic/claude-opus-4.7")
response = agent.chat("Explain quantum computing briefly")
```

See the [Python Library guide](../user-guide/features/code-execution.md) for full API usage.

## Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

#### `xhermes: command not found` after installation

**Cause:** Your shell hasn't reloaded the updated PATH.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Reload your shell profile
source ~/.bashrc    # bash
source ~/.zshrc     # zsh

# Or start a new terminal session
```

If it still doesn't work, verify the install location:
```bash
which xhermes
ls ~/.local/bin/xhermes
```

:::tip
The installer adds `~/.local/bin` to your PATH. If you use a non-standard shell config, add `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"` manually.
:::

#### Python version too old

**Cause:** XHermes requires Python 3.11 or newer.

**Solution:**
```bash
python3 --version   # Check current version

# Install a newer Python
sudo apt install python3.12   # Ubuntu/Debian
brew install python@3.12      # macOS
```

The installer handles this automatically — if you see this error during manual installation, upgrade Python first.

#### Terminal commands say `node: command not found` (or `nvm`, `pyenv`, `asdf`, …)

**Cause:** XHermes builds a per-session environment snapshot by running `bash -l` once at startup. A bash login shell reads `/etc/profile`, `~/.bash_profile`, and `~/.profile`, but **does not source `~/.bashrc`** — so tools that install themselves there (`nvm`, `asdf`, `pyenv`, `cargo`, custom `PATH` exports) stay invisible to the snapshot. This most commonly happens when XHermes runs under systemd or in a minimal shell where nothing has pre-loaded the interactive shell profile.

**Solution:** XHermes auto-sources `~/.bashrc` by default. If that's not enough — e.g. you're a zsh user whose PATH lives in `~/.zshrc`, or you init `nvm` from a standalone file — list the extra files to source in `~/.xhermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
terminal:
  shell_init_files:
    - ~/.zshrc                     # zsh users: pulls zsh-managed PATH into the bash snapshot
    - ~/.nvm/nvm.sh                # direct nvm init (works regardless of shell)
    - /etc/profile.d/cargo.sh      # system-wide rc files
  # When this list is set, the default ~/.bashrc auto-source is NOT added —
  # include it explicitly if you want both:
  #   - ~/.bashrc
  #   - ~/.zshrc
```

Missing files are skipped silently. Sourcing happens in bash, so files that rely on zsh-only syntax may error — if that's a concern, source just the PATH-setting portion (e.g. nvm's `nvm.sh` directly) rather than the whole rc file.

To disable the auto-source behaviour (strict login-shell semantics only):

```yaml
terminal:
  auto_source_bashrc: false
```

#### `uv: command not found`

**Cause:** The `uv` package manager isn't installed or not in PATH.

**Solution:**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### Permission denied errors during install

**Cause:** Insufficient permissions to write to the install directory.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Don't use sudo with the installer — it installs to ~/.local/bin
# If you previously installed with sudo, clean up:
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/xhermes
# Then re-run the standard installer
curl -fsSL https://xhermes-agent.nousresearch.com/install.sh | bash
```

---

### Provider & Model Issues

#### `/model` only shows one provider / can't switch providers

**Cause:** `/model` (inside a chat session) can only switch between providers you've **already configured**. If you've only set up OpenRouter, that's all `/model` will show.

**Solution:** Exit your session and use `xhermes model` from your terminal to add new providers:

```bash
# Exit the XHermes chat session first (Ctrl+C or /quit)

# Run the full provider setup wizard
xhermes model

# This lets you: add providers, run OAuth, enter API keys, configure endpoints
```

After adding a new provider via `xhermes model`, start a new chat session — `/model` will now show all your configured providers.

:::tip Quick reference
| Want to... | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| Add a new provider | `xhermes model` (from terminal) |
| Enter/change API keys | `xhermes model` (from terminal) |
| Switch model mid-session | `/model <name>` (inside session) |
| Switch to different configured provider | `/model provider:model` (inside session) |
:::

#### API key not working

**Cause:** Key is missing, expired, incorrectly set, or for the wrong provider.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check your configuration
xhermes config show

# Re-configure your provider
xhermes model

# Or set directly
xhermes config set OPENROUTER_API_KEY sk-or-v1-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

:::warning
Make sure the key matches the provider. An OpenAI key won't work with OpenRouter and vice versa. Check `~/.xhermes/.env` for conflicting entries.
:::

#### Model not available / model not found

**Cause:** The model identifier is incorrect or not available on your provider.

**Solution:**
```bash
# List available models for your provider
xhermes model

# Set a valid model
xhermes config set HERMES_MODEL anthropic/claude-opus-4.7

# Or specify per-session
xhermes chat --model openrouter/meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct
```

#### Rate limiting (429 errors)

**Cause:** You've exceeded your provider's rate limits.

**Solution:** Wait a moment and retry. For sustained usage, consider:
- Upgrading your provider plan
- Switching to a different model or provider
- Using `xhermes chat --provider <alternative>` to route to a different backend

#### Context length exceeded

**Cause:** The conversation has grown too long for the model's context window, or XHermes detected the wrong context length for your model.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Compress the current session
/compress

# Or start a fresh session
xhermes chat

# Use a model with a larger context window
xhermes chat --model openrouter/google/gemini-3-flash-preview
```

If this happens on the first long conversation, XHermes may have the wrong context length for your model. Check what it detected:

Look at the CLI startup line — it shows the detected context length (e.g., `📊 Context limit: 128000 tokens`). You can also check with `/usage` during a session.

To fix context detection, set it explicitly:

```yaml
# In ~/.xhermes/config.yaml
model:
  default: your-model-name
  context_length: 131072  # your model's actual context window
```

Or for custom endpoints, add it per-model on the provider entry:

```yaml
providers:
  my-server:
    api: "http://localhost:11434/v1"
    models:
      qwen3.5:27b:
        context_length: 64000
```

(Older configs use the legacy `custom_providers:` list — still supported and auto-migrated to `providers:`.)

See [Context Length Detection](../integrations/providers.md#context-length-detection) for how auto-detection works and all override options.

---

### Terminal Issues

#### Command blocked as dangerous

**Cause:** XHermes detected a potentially destructive command (e.g., `rm -rf`, `DROP TABLE`). This is a safety feature.

**Solution:** When prompted, review the command and type `y` to approve it. You can also:
- Ask the agent to use a safer alternative
- See the full list of dangerous patterns in the [Security docs](../user-guide/security.md)

:::tip
This is working as intended — XHermes never silently runs destructive commands. The approval prompt shows you exactly what will execute.
:::

#### `sudo` not working via messaging gateway

**Cause:** The messaging gateway runs without an interactive terminal, so `sudo` cannot prompt for a password.

**Solution:**
- Avoid `sudo` in messaging — ask the agent to find alternatives
- If you must use `sudo`, configure passwordless sudo for specific commands in `/etc/sudoers`
- Or switch to the terminal interface for administrative tasks: `xhermes chat`

#### Docker backend not connecting

**Cause:** Docker daemon isn't running or the user lacks permissions.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check Docker is running
docker info

# Add your user to the docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker

# Verify
docker run hello-world
```

---

### Messaging Issues

#### Bot not responding to messages

**Cause:** The bot isn't running, isn't authorized, or your user isn't in the allowlist.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if the gateway is running
xhermes gateway status

# Start the gateway
xhermes gateway start

# Check logs for errors
cat ~/.xhermes/logs/gateway.log | tail -50
```

#### Messages not delivering

**Cause:** Network issues, bot token expired, or platform webhook misconfiguration.

**Solution:**
- Verify your bot token is valid with `xhermes gateway setup`
- Check gateway logs: `cat ~/.xhermes/logs/gateway.log | tail -50`
- For webhook-based platforms (Slack, WhatsApp), ensure your server is publicly accessible

#### Allowlist confusion — who can talk to the bot?

**Cause:** Authorization mode determines who gets access.

**Solution:**

| Mode | How it works |
|------|-------------|
| **Allowlist** | Only user IDs listed in config can interact |
| **DM pairing** | First user to message in DM claims exclusive access |
| **Open** | Anyone can interact (not recommended for production) |

Configure in `~/.xhermes/config.yaml` under your gateway's settings. See the [Messaging docs](../user-guide/messaging/index.md).

#### Gateway won't start

**Cause:** Missing dependencies, port conflicts, or misconfigured tokens.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Install core messaging gateway dependencies
cd ~/.xhermes/xhermes-agent && uv pip install -e ".[messaging]"  # Telegram, Discord, Slack, and shared gateway deps

# Check for port conflicts
lsof -i :8080

# Verify configuration
xhermes config show
```

#### WSL: Gateway keeps disconnecting or `xhermes gateway start` fails

**Cause:** WSL's systemd support is unreliable. Many WSL2 installations don't have systemd enabled, and even when enabled, services may not survive WSL restarts or Windows idle shutdowns.

**Solution:** Use foreground mode instead of the systemd service:

```bash
# Option 1: Direct foreground (simplest)
xhermes gateway run

# Option 2: Persistent via tmux (survives terminal close)
tmux new -s xhermes 'xhermes gateway run'
# Reattach later: tmux attach -t xhermes

# Option 3: Background via nohup
nohup xhermes gateway run > ~/.xhermes/logs/gateway.log 2>&1 &
```

If you want to try systemd anyway, make sure it's enabled:

1. Open `/etc/wsl.conf` (create it if it doesn't exist)
2. Add:
   ```ini
   [boot]
   systemd=true
   ```
3. From PowerShell: `wsl --shutdown`
4. Reopen your WSL terminal
5. Verify: `systemctl is-system-running` should say "running" or "degraded"

:::tip Auto-start on Windows boot
For reliable auto-start, use Windows Task Scheduler to launch WSL + the gateway on login:
1. Create a task that runs `wsl -d Ubuntu -- bash -lc 'xhermes gateway run'`
2. Set it to trigger on user logon
:::

#### macOS: Node.js / ffmpeg / other tools not found by gateway

**Cause:** launchd services inherit a minimal PATH (`/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`) that doesn't include Homebrew, nvm, cargo, or other user-installed tool directories. This commonly breaks the WhatsApp bridge (`node not found`) or voice transcription (`ffmpeg not found`).

**Solution:** The gateway captures your shell PATH when you run `xhermes gateway install`. If you installed tools after setting up the gateway, re-run the install to capture the updated PATH:

```bash
xhermes gateway install    # Re-snapshots your current PATH
xhermes gateway start      # Detects the updated plist and reloads
```

You can verify the plist has the correct PATH:
```bash
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Print :EnvironmentVariables:PATH" \
  ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.xhermes.gateway.plist
```

---

### Performance Issues

#### Slow responses

**Cause:** Large model, distant API server, or heavy system prompt with many tools.

**Solution:**
- Try a faster/smaller model: `xhermes chat --model openrouter/meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct`
- Reduce active toolsets: `xhermes chat -t "terminal"`
- Check your network latency to the provider
- For local models, ensure you have enough GPU VRAM

#### High token usage

**Cause:** Long conversations, verbose system prompts, or many tool calls accumulating context.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Compress the conversation to reduce tokens
/compress

# Check session token usage
/usage
```

:::tip
Use `/compress` regularly during long sessions. It summarizes the conversation history and reduces token usage significantly while preserving context.
:::

#### Session getting too long

**Cause:** Extended conversations accumulate messages and tool outputs, approaching context limits.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Compress current session (preserves key context)
/compress

# Start a new session with a reference to the old one
xhermes chat

# Resume a specific session later if needed
xhermes chat --continue
```

---

### MCP Issues

#### MCP server not connecting

**Cause:** Server binary not found, wrong command path, or missing runtime.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Ensure MCP dependencies are installed (already included in standard install)
cd ~/.xhermes/xhermes-agent && uv pip install -e ".[mcp]"

# For npm-based servers, ensure Node.js is available
node --version
npx --version

# Test the server manually
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /tmp
```

Verify your `~/.xhermes/config.yaml` MCP configuration:
```yaml
mcp_servers:
  filesystem:
    command: "npx"
    args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/home/user/docs"]
```

#### Tools not showing up from MCP server

**Cause:** Server started but tool discovery failed, tools were filtered out by config, or the server does not support the MCP capability you expected.

**Solution:**
- Check gateway/agent logs for MCP connection errors
- Ensure the server responds to the `tools/list` RPC method
- Review any `tools.include`, `tools.exclude`, `tools.resources`, `tools.prompts`, or `enabled` settings under that server
- Remember that resource/prompt utility tools are only registered when the session actually supports those capabilities
- Use `/reload-mcp` after changing config

```bash
# Verify MCP servers are configured
xhermes config show | grep -A 12 mcp_servers

# Restart XHermes or reload MCP after config changes
xhermes chat
```

- [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](/user-guide/features/mcp)
- [Use MCP with XHermes](/guides/use-mcp-with-xhermes)
- [MCP Config Reference](/reference/mcp-config-reference)

#### MCP timeout errors

**Cause:** The MCP server is taking too long to respond, or it crashed during execution.

**Solution:**
- Increase the timeout in your MCP server config if supported
- Check if the MCP server process is still running
- For remote HTTP MCP servers, check network connectivity

:::warning
If an MCP server crashes mid-request, XHermes will report a timeout. Check the server's own logs (not just XHermes logs) to diagnose the root cause.

## Profiles

### How do profiles differ from just setting HERMES_HOME?

Profiles are a managed layer on top of `HERMES_HOME`. You *could* manually set `HERMES_HOME=/some/path` before every command, but profiles handle all the plumbing for you: creating the directory structure, generating shell aliases (`xhermes-work`), tracking the active profile in `~/.xhermes/active_profile`, and syncing skill updates across all profiles automatically. They also integrate with tab completion so you don't have to remember paths.

### Can two profiles share the same bot token?

No. Each messaging platform (Telegram, Discord, etc.) requires exclusive access to a bot token. If two profiles try to use the same token simultaneously, the second gateway will fail to connect. Create a separate bot per profile — for Telegram, talk to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) to make additional bots.

### Do profiles share memory or sessions?

No. Each profile has its own memory store, session database, and skills directory. They are completely isolated. If you want to start a new profile with existing memories and sessions, use `xhermes profile create newname --clone-all` to copy everything from the current profile, or add `--clone-from <profile>` to copy from a specific source profile.

### What happens when I run `xhermes update`?

`xhermes update` pulls the latest code and reinstalls dependencies **once** (not per-profile). It then syncs updated skills to all profiles automatically. You only need to run `xhermes update` once — it covers every profile on the machine.


### How many profiles can I run?

There is no hard limit. Each profile is just a directory under `~/.xhermes/profiles/`. The practical limit depends on your disk space and how many concurrent gateways your system can handle (each gateway is a lightweight Python process). Running dozens of profiles is fine; each idle profile uses no resources.

---

## Workflows & Patterns

### Using different models for different tasks (multi-model workflows)

**Scenario:** You use GPT-5.4 as your daily driver, but Gemini or Grok writes better social media content. Manually switching models every time is tedious.

**Solution: Delegation config.** XHermes can route subagents to a different model automatically. Set this in `~/.xhermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
delegation:
  model: "google/gemini-3-flash-preview"   # subagents use this model
  provider: "openrouter"                    # provider for subagents
```

Now when you tell XHermes "write me a Twitter thread about X" and it spawns a `delegate_task` subagent, that subagent runs on Gemini instead of your main model. Your primary conversation stays on GPT-5.4.

You can also be explicit in your prompt: *"Delegate a task to write social media posts about our product launch. Use your subagent for the actual writing."* The agent will use `delegate_task`, which automatically picks up the delegation config.

For one-off model switches without delegation, use `/model` in the CLI:

```bash
/model google/gemini-3-flash-preview    # switch for this session
# ... write your content ...
/model openai/gpt-5.4                   # switch back
```

:::warning
Each `/model` switch resets the prompt cache — the cache key includes the model, so the first message after every switch re-reads the whole conversation at full input price. On long sessions, prefer delegation (subagents get their own fresh context) or a new session over repeated back-and-forth switching.
:::

See [Subagent Delegation](../user-guide/features/delegation.md) for more on how delegation works.

### Running multiple agents on one WhatsApp number (per-chat binding)

**Scenario:** In OpenClaw, you had multiple independent agents bound to specific WhatsApp chats — one for a family shopping list group, another for your private chat. Can XHermes do this?

**Current limitation:** XHermes profiles each require their own WhatsApp number/session. You cannot bind multiple profiles to different chats on the same WhatsApp number — the WhatsApp bridge (Baileys) uses one authenticated session per number.

**Workarounds:**

1. **Use a single profile with personality switching.** Create different `AGENTS.md` context files or use the `/personality` command to change behavior per chat. The agent sees which chat it's in and can adapt.

2. **Use cron jobs for specialized tasks.** For a shopping list tracker, set up a cron job that monitors a specific chat and manages the list — no separate agent needed.

3. **Use separate numbers.** If you need truly independent agents, pair each profile with its own WhatsApp number. Virtual numbers from services like Google Voice work for this.

4. **Use Telegram or Discord instead.** These platforms support per-chat binding more naturally — each Telegram group or Discord channel gets its own session, and you can run multiple bot tokens (one per profile) on the same account.

See [Profiles](../user-guide/profiles.md) and [WhatsApp setup](../user-guide/messaging/whatsapp.md) for more details.

### Controlling what shows up in Telegram (hiding logs and reasoning)

**Scenario:** You see gateway exec logs, XHermes reasoning, and tool call details in Telegram instead of just the final output.

**Solution:** The `display.tool_progress` setting in `config.yaml` controls how much tool activity is shown:

```yaml
display:
  tool_progress: "off"   # options: off, new, all, verbose
```

- **`off`** — Only the final response. No tool calls, no reasoning, no logs.
- **`new`** — Shows new tool calls as they happen (brief one-liners).
- **`all`** — Shows all tool activity including results.
- **`verbose`** — Full detail including tool arguments and outputs.

For messaging platforms, `off` or `new` is usually what you want. After editing `config.yaml`, restart the gateway for changes to take effect.

You can also toggle this per-session with the `/verbose` command (if enabled):

```yaml
display:
  tool_progress_command: true   # enables /verbose in the gateway
```

### Managing skills on Telegram (slash command limit)

**Scenario:** Telegram has a 100 slash command limit, and your skills are pushing past it. You want to disable skills you don't need on Telegram, but `xhermes skills config` settings don't seem to take effect.

**Solution:** Use `xhermes skills config` to disable skills per-platform. This writes to `config.yaml`:

```yaml
skills:
  disabled: []                    # globally disabled skills
  platform_disabled:
    telegram: [skill-a, skill-b]  # disabled only on telegram
```

After changing this, **restart the gateway** (`xhermes gateway restart` or kill and relaunch). The Telegram bot command menu rebuilds on startup.

:::tip
Skills with very long descriptions are truncated to 40 characters in the Telegram menu to stay within payload size limits. If skills aren't appearing, it may be a total payload size issue rather than the 100 command count limit — disabling unused skills helps with both.
:::

### Shared thread sessions (multiple users, one conversation)

**Scenario:** You have a Telegram or Discord thread where multiple people mention the bot. You want all mentions in that thread to be part of one shared conversation, not separate per-user sessions.

**Current behavior:** XHermes creates sessions keyed by user ID on most platforms, so each person gets their own conversation context. This is by design for privacy and context isolation.

**Workarounds:**

1. **Use Slack.** Slack sessions are keyed by thread, not by user. Multiple users in the same thread share one conversation — exactly the behavior you're describing. This is the most natural fit.

2. **Use a group chat with a single user.** If one person is the designated "operator" who relays questions, the session stays unified. Others can read along.

3. **Use a Discord channel.** Discord sessions are keyed by channel, so all users in the same channel share context. Use a dedicated channel for the shared conversation.

### Exporting XHermes to another machine

**Scenario:** You've built up skills, cron jobs, and memories on one machine and want to move everything to a new dedicated Linux box.

**Solution:**

1. Install XHermes Agent on the new machine:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://xhermes-agent.nousresearch.com/install.sh | bash
   ```

2. On the **source machine**, create a full backup:
   ```bash
   xhermes backup
   ```
   This creates a zip of your entire `~/.xhermes/` directory — config, API keys, memories, skills, sessions, and profiles — saved to your home directory as `~/xhermes-backup-<timestamp>.zip`.

3. Copy the zip to the new machine and import it:
   ```bash
   # On the source machine
   scp ~/xhermes-backup-<timestamp>.zip newmachine:~/

   # On the new machine
   xhermes import ~/xhermes-backup-<timestamp>.zip
   ```

4. On the new machine, run `xhermes setup` to verify API keys and provider config are working.

### Moving a single profile to another machine

**Scenario:** You want to move or share one specific profile — not your full installation.

```bash
# On the source machine
xhermes profile export work ./work-backup.tar.gz

# Copy the file to the target machine, then:
xhermes profile import ./work-backup.tar.gz work
```

The imported profile will have all config, memories, sessions, and skills from the export. You may need to update paths or re-authenticate with providers if the new machine has a different setup.

### `xhermes backup` vs `xhermes profile export`

| Feature | `xhermes backup` | `xhermes profile export` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Use Case** | **Full machine migration** | **Porting/sharing a specific profile** |
| **Scope** | Global (entire `~/.xhermes` directory) | Local (single profile directory) |
| **Includes** | All profiles, global config, API keys, sessions | Single profile: SOUL.md, memories, sessions, skills |
| **Credentials** | **Included** (`.env` and `auth.json`) | **Excluded** (stripped for safe sharing) |
| **Format** | `.zip` | `.tar.gz` |

**Manual fallback (rsync):** If you prefer to copy files directly, exclude the code repo:
```bash
rsync -av --exclude='xhermes-agent' ~/.xhermes/ newmachine:~/.xhermes/
```

:::tip
`xhermes backup` produces a consistent snapshot even while XHermes is actively running. The restored archive excludes machine-local runtime files like `gateway.pid` and `cron.pid`.

### Permission denied when reloading shell after install

**Scenario:** After running the XHermes installer, `source ~/.zshrc` gives a permission denied error.

**Cause:** This usually happens when `~/.zshrc` (or `~/.bashrc`) has incorrect file permissions, or when the installer couldn't write to it cleanly. It's not a XHermes-specific issue — it's a shell config permissions problem.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check permissions
ls -la ~/.zshrc

# Fix if needed (should be -rw-r--r-- or 644)
chmod 644 ~/.zshrc

# Then reload
source ~/.zshrc

# Or just open a new terminal window — it picks up PATH changes automatically
```

If the installer added the PATH line but permissions are wrong, you can add it manually:
```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

### Error 400 on first agent run

**Scenario:** Setup completes fine, but the first chat attempt fails with HTTP 400.

**Cause:** Usually a model name mismatch — the configured model doesn't exist on your provider, or the API key doesn't have access to it.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check what model and provider are configured
xhermes config show | head -20

# Re-run model selection
xhermes model

# Or test with a known-good model
xhermes chat -q "hello" --model anthropic/claude-opus-4.7
```

If using OpenRouter, make sure your API key has credits. A 400 from OpenRouter often means the model requires a paid plan or the model ID has a typo.
